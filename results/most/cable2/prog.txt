```c
// Refactored code with clear comments
#include <stdio.h>

// Declaration of a Unicode string
unsigned int *salmon = U"   is very yummy";

// Main function to execute the program
int main() {
    // Print multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10
    for (int number = 1; number <= 10; number++) {
        printf("%d * %d = %d\n", number, number, number * number);
    }

    // Print the 'salmon' string
    while (putchar(*salmon++));

    return 0;
}
```

Note: The refactored code improves readability by removing unnecessary macro definitions and adding comments. It also includes a return statement at the end of `main` for better practices. The `putchar` loop now directly follows the multiplication table for better flow and understanding.
