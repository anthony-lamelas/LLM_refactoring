  "LLM_context": "This directory contains only the C source files of an IOCCC winning entry. The code is intentionally obfuscated or unusually constructed. When analyzing, first read descriptor.json for year, award, and authors. Focus on top-of-file comments, macros, and unusual control flow to infer purpose. Avoid relying on removed README/Makefiles from the original repo."
